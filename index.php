<h1>Agile Yak</h1>

<p>I love taking an agile approach to life and software projects!</p>
<p>I never thought I would one day want to be an agile yak. What is an agile yak anyway? As a software professional I find myself turning to agility practices to get things done in a timely and high quality fashion.</p>
